This website is \*clone of ["obelisk.me.uk/6502/"](https://web.archive.org/web/20210727210256/http://obelisk.me.uk/6502/), the original site was not available and after some googling i found out the original Author Andrew Jabobs aka Bitwise passed away in 2021 due to Covid-19. May His Soul Rest In Peace.
